		  <h2>What Did I Learn?</h2>
			<p>By working at these jobs, I really learned what "hard work" is. I was a groundskeeper, and a janitor at FHC. I worked 40 hours a week cleaning, whether it was outside or inside. With this job, I didn't receive any experience working with customers, but instead I worked with myself. I built myself mentally and physically with this job. I furthered my time management and organization skills by working with deadlines, and managers </P>
			
			<p>Although I did a lot of the same activities I did at FHC, as I did at Big-Tex, I got more customer service experience. I would talk to customers as I was preparing their trailer to leave the yard, telling them what I was doing and how all of the features worked. I worked on my communication skills with real customers, which was a good experience. Again, I learned what I did not want to do with my life, I was a laborer, so I did a lot of hard work 6 days a week for not a lot of money, and that is not what I want to do with my life.</p>
